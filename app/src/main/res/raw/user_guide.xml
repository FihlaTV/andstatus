        <p>Introduction</p>
    </title>
    <p>AndStatus is an Open Source low traffic social networking
        client with tree-like threaded conversations.
        It supports multiple protocols, including GNU social, Twitter and Pump.io.
        AndStatus combines your accounts from all networks into one Timeline
        and allows you reading and posting even while you are offline.</p>
    <p>Link to this guide is available in the Action bar-&gt;Help.</p>
    <p><a xlink:href="http://andstatus.org/changelog.html">Change Log</a> will allow you to see descriptions
        and links to discussions of all features of AndStatus.</p>
    <p>Most of Users' <strong>questions</strong> are already answered in corresponding "Issues" topics, specially
        labeled as "Questions&amp;Answers". See and search among them:

    <title>
        <p>1. Getting started</p>
    </title>
    <p>Tap "Get Started" button below: screen to add
        new account will be opened.
    </p>
    <p>First you will be prompted to select a type of a Social network, and then - an instance (a server)
        of the selected type. Several instances of each type are preconfigured.
    </p>
    <p>In a case your ("GNU social"-type of) system is not listed,
        tap the "Discover open instances" menu item to pick a system
        from a live online list, maintained by the GNU social community;
        or "Add new system" manually prior to adding a new account.</p>
    <p>For Twitter you are allowed to press "Add this account"
        immediately.
        For other systems you will be prompted to type your Username and Password
        before you will be allowed to "Add this account".</p>
    <p>After successful creation of an account, please tap "left arrow"
        on an
        "Action bar" or "Back" button on your device.
        This time a Home Timeline will be opened,
        and messages for this account will start downloading from the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>Congratulations! Please read below about what you can do further.
    </p>
    <p>And don't forget to add AndStatus's widget to a Home screen of Your
        device:
        the widget will inform you about new messages and may be used to launch
        AndStatus.
    </p>

        <p>2. AndStatus basics</p>
    </title>
    <p>The first view of AndStatus (after at least one account has been added)
        contains a Home Timeline.
    </p>
    <p>In order to perform an action on a message in the list you
        should
        <strong>long press</strong>
        it to access its "Context menu".
    </p>
    <p>You may <strong>tap</strong>
        a message to get more details on it and to see
        the conversation tree to which the message belongs.
    </p>
    <p>Open a "Navigation Drawer" on the left and tap the current Timeline
        type item ("Home")
        to switch to the other views.
    </p>

        <p>3. Sending and replying</p>
    </title>
    <p>1. In order to update your status, tap the "Post" button ("Tweet" for Twitter).
        It resembles an "Envelope+".
        A message editor will open at a bottom of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>2. Enter your message content in the text area.
    </p>
    <p>3. Optionally, attach an image to your post. While the message Editor is visible,
        another button appears on an Action bar: "Paperclip+".
        (The "Attach" menu item may be hidden under an "Overflow" button: "three vertical dots").
        Tap the "Attach" button and select a picture. After successful attachment of the image,
        the text "(with media)" will appear below the text area, in which you're composing your message.
    </p>
    <p>4. Tap <strong>Send</strong> to send your message. If you are offline, the message will be
        put into a Queue to be automatically sent later. (Use "Commands in a queue" menu item
        to see your unsent messages in the Queue)
    </p>
    <p>In order to reply, <strong>hold down</strong>
        a message and select <strong>Reply</strong>
        from a Context menu, type in your reply at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>To abort a post or reply, simply tap the "Hide" button to hide the
       text area.</p>

        <p>4. Attached images: sending and showing</p>
    </title>
    <section>
        <title>
            <p>4.1. Sending images</p>
        </title>
        <p>First way to attach a picture to a post is described in a previous section: you can attach
            an image to a message, while creating the message.
        </p>
        <p>Another way to send an image is to "Share" it via AndStatus: here you start from an image
            in another application. E.g. you want to take a photo and send it to a social network.
            Do this:
        </p>
        <p>1. Take a picture / find it in a Gallery and click on the picture's thumbnail to open it.
        </p>
        <p>2. Select "Share" in the menu. Most of applications do have a "Share" action...
        </p>
        <p>3. Select "AndStatus" in a list of applications, which declared that they
            can share images.
        </p>
        <p>4. Now you're in AndStatus. If you have more than one account,
            select a desired account, otherwise you will be immediately forwarded to
            a Message Editor.</p>
        <p>5. Now you are in a Message Editor, with the picture already attached
            (you should see the "(with media)" text above a message text box).
        </p>
        <p>6. Type any text and tap "Send". (It's not allowed to send an image without any text)
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>
            <p>4.2. Showing attached images</p>
        </title>
        <p>We have these settings (in the Settings->Attachments):</p>
        <p>1. "Download and display attached images" checkbox. If it's turned off, attachments
            are not even downloaded thus conserving your network traffic.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that when you turn this option on, images are not shown immediately,
            because AndStatus needs some time to download them in a background.
        </p>
        <p>2. "Attach images to my messages". When "on", you can use "Paperclip+" button
            ("Attach" menu item) to attach images to your message.
            When "off", the "Paperclip", used to attach an image to your post, is hidden.
        </p>

    <title>
        <p>5. Private (direct) messages</p>
    </title>
    <p>Open a Navigation Drawer on a left, tap current Timeline type
        item (Home)
        and select
        <strong>Private</strong>
        from the list.
    </p>
    <p>In order to <strong>delete</strong>
        your message (public or private),
        <strong>hold down</strong> on it and select
        <strong>Remove message</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>New messages are fetched to timelines in a background
        if you have turned on  <strong>Automatic sync</strong>
        in Android "Account and Sync" settings for this
        AndStatus Account.
        In any case you may always get updates from the Internet
        manually using "Reload" command on an Action bar.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <title>
        <p>6. Mentions</p>
    </title>
    <p>Tap current Timeline type item in a Navigation Drawer
        and then select
        <strong>Mentions</strong>
        .
    </p>
    <p>Mentions will list every message that mentions your
        <strong>@username</strong>
        (or even mentions of all your AndStatus accounts for a
        "combined" timeline).
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <title>
        <p>7. Search (local search)</p>
    </title>
    <p>Local search searches among messages already loaded from the
        Internet.
        Hence it is available even offline.
    </p>
    <p>1. In order to find any word or phrase in a text of messages,
        select <strong>Search</strong>
        on an Action bar or click a dedicated
        <strong>Search</strong> button on your device.
    </p>
    <p>If you wish to show messages from a specific user,
        please search for "username".</p>
    <p>To see mentions of a specific User, search for "@username".
    </p>
    <p>2. To search quickly for messages by a user
        (an Author or a Sender of a selected message), select
        "Messages by UserName" from the context menu of the message.
        This is actually sort of a Global Search (see below).
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <title>
        <p>8. Global search</p>
    </title>
    <p>Global search function sends a search request directly to
        Social networks' servers.
        This is why live Internet connection to the networks is required.
    </p>
    <p>First, you are presented with the results of the Local search.
        In parallel, AndStatus downloads results
        from a Social network of the selected Account
        (or from all Social networks, if a Timeline is
        "combined").
        Search results are being updated upon receiving responses from the servers.
        In a case of connection error
        (i.e. no response from a server of a Social network)
        you will see results of a Local Search only.
    </p>
    <p>Please note that pump.io system doesn't support Global search yet.
    </p>
    <p>1. Global search by a word or a phrase is initiated
        using its "Global search" item on an "Action bar".</p>
    <p>2. Another way to search globally for messages by an Author or a Sender
        of the selected message is to select
        "Messages by UserName" from a Context menu of this message.</p>
