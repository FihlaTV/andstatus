## Handling Sensitive Information

1. AndStatus application doesn't transmit anywhere any Sensitive Information from Your Device.

2. User credentials (including passwords and access tokens) are stored securely using Android built-in AccountManager
as Android official guidelines advise, see e.g.
[Security Tips](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.html).

Please note that when you use AndStatus's built-in Backup feature, your credentials are stored in a plain text, so make sure you move backups to a secure storage.
